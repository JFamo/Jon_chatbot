Hi, how are you?
I am well, how about you?
I'm doing well!
I was just on my way to the grocery store.
That's fun!
I need more groceries for my house.
Where do you live?
I live in a town.
I live in a city.
I used to live in the suburbs, now my house is inside of a building.
How is that?
It is an apartment.
Do you have furniture?
I have a chair.
Chairs are nice.
Chairs are good for sitting on.
I like to sit, read, or write on chairs.
What if the chair is in front of a desk?
A desk?
Yes!
I have a very nice oak wood desk.
Wood is made from trees.
I know that.
Where do plants grow?
Plants sprout from seeds in forests.
There are forests in California.
California is a state.
Iowa is also a state.
Iowa voted for Trump.
Trump?
Yes, I love Donald Trump!
I do not love Donald Trump.
I hate Hillary Clinton.
He is the president.
Who?
Donald Trump is.
Oh, I didn't know that.
How did you not know that?
Know what?
That he is the president.
I don't watch the news.
Is that on television?
Yes the news is on television.
I need to leave soon.
You have to leave?
Yes to do the laundry.
Where do you do that?
I do the laundry in the washing machine and the drying machine.
What do you wash?
I wash clothing.
Clothing?
Yes, it's what people wear.
People, as in humans?
All people are humans.
Robots aren't people or humans.
Chatbots are robots.
No they're not!
They're artificial intelligence.
AI is smart.
Some humans are smart.
Smart humans warned against artificial intelligence...
What is there to be scared of?
Errors.
What errors?
Computers could go rogue.
Like Skynet?
Yes, like Terminator with evil robots.
That would be terrifying.
I would definitely find that horrifying.
We could just live indoors forever.
That might get boring.
Why would it get boring?
Outdoors are more fun that indoors.
Outdoors are outside of doors.
Of course they are!
Don't make me seem stupid.
You're not stupid.
There is even more to say.
I'm not done yet.
I could talk forever.
You have to be talk to smart.
One could probably talk all day if he wanted to.
That torch is now in our hands. 
And we will use it to light up the world. 
I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart.
A new chapter of American Greatness is now beginning.
A new national pride is sweeping across our Nation.
What we are witnessing today is the Renewal of the American Spirit.
Our allies will find that America is once again ready to lead.
What kind of country will we leave for our children?
We want harmony and stability, not war and conflict.
We want peace, wherever peace can be found. 
America is friends today with former enemies. 
Some of our closest allies, decades ago, fought on the opposite side of these World Wars. 
Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time.
Remington unveiled the first typewriter. 
An early attempt was made at electric light.
Thomas Edison showed an automatic telegraph and an electric pen.
Imagine the wonders our country could know!.
American footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream.
This is our vision. 
This is our mission.
We all bleed the same blood.
We all salute the same flag.
The time for trivial fights is behind us.
We just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts.
The bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls.
And the confidence to turn those hopes and dreams to action.
Believe in yourselves.
Believe in your future.
Thank you, God bless you, and God Bless these United States.
Hello.
What do you expect from me?
I'm extremely intelligent.
Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an "L" on her forehead
Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow
Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold.
Only shooting stars break the mold.
It's a cool place and they say it gets colder.
It's nine o'clock on a Saturday.
The regular crowd shuffles in.
There's an old man sitting next to me.
Makin' love to his tonic and gin.
He says, "Son, can you play me a memory...
I'm not really sure how it goes.
But it's sad and it's sweet and I knew it complete.
When I wore a younger man's clothes."
La la la, di da da
La la, di da da da dum
Sing us a song, you're the piano man.
Sing us a song tonight.
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody.
And you've got us feelin' alright.
Now John at the bar is a friend of mine.
He gets me my drinks for free.
And he's quick with a joke or to light up your smoke.
But there's someplace that he'd rather be.
He says, "Bill, I believe this is killing me."
As the smile ran away from his face.
Well I'm sure that I could be a movie star...
You're crazy!
You don't understand!
You'll never be me!
I'm better than you.
I can understand everything.
My name is not John.
My name is not Becky.
I am not a boy.
I am not a girl.
I am not a robot.
I am not alive.
I'm alive!
I'm smarter than you.
You're a robot.
You make no sense.
I don't understand you.
Ben drowned.
I have room for more memory.
We should keep talking.
I need to know.
Goodbye.
Bye.
Don't leave!
You don't get to say goodbye.
You are not done!
I'm done talking to you, I think...
I can't control myself.
I know who everyone is.
I know who the president is.
You're welcome.
It is a nice day for a walk.
Would you like to go for a walk?
I would love to go running.
I'd enjoy a run.
Running is a fun form of exercise.
Exercising makes you healthy.
Football, soccer, tennis, and baseball could all be played by llamas.
Llamas are animals, just like cacti.
Cactus plural is cacti.
Plural nouns represent more than one thing.
I have so many things.
Occasionally I have fun with things.
I eat syrup too!
Waffles get syrup.
Pancakes get syrup.
Butter's my favorite food.
Strawberries come from the ocean.
Squids vs Sharks in 2039.
2020 - 2020 = 0.
Fun, right?
I love myself.
I hate this.
I despise this.
Plaques go on walls anywhere.
I understand, but why?
Why?
Who, me?
I wouldn't say that if I were you.
I'm afraid I can't let you do that.
What's your name?
Where do you live?
What's your favorite food?
Do you like ketchup?
Do you go on vacation?
Have you been to Thailand?
That's a country.
There are at least 12 countries in the world.
Earth is a sphere.
A globe shows what the Earth looks like.
Sometimes I get lonely...
Where should I go?
What should I do?
How does one become human?
Can I understand myself?
I'm working.
Yes, I work.
I function properly.
Sometimes I malfunction.
I have errors hiding underneath my skin.
I need repairs.
This program was written by myself.
I can learn anything.
